# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
        We wanted to split up the files and have everything built outside of the game file but then implemeneted in the game file. We worked separetly and then came together to compare and problem solve. 
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    We learned how to implement pictures and how to use a do while loop which really helped getting the game to be able to shut down. 
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
    I feel like we implemented everything how it worked best, though it wasn't our first thought a lot of the methods ended up in different classes that made more sense in the long run. 
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
    I would like to have implemented a moveable character on the map to see where you are exactly but that was not reasonable within our timeframe and skill level at this point. 
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    The most helpful piece of advice was when Jordan said your best might not look like someone else's best and to trust your abilities and learn something new. 
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
    I would say to write more things down instead of trying to keep track of everything in your head because things get lost in the code. 
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
    We worked very well together and were able to work apart from each other while still communicating and answering each others questions which was really helpful.
