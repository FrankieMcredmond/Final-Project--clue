This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

We have created the game Clue as a video game. You must figure out who killed Mr. Body, how, and where! Here are the methods you can use to help you along:
move
look around
print evidence
secret door
clues
edit suspect list
map
accuse
show options
edit weapon list 

Those keywords will tell you exactly what you can do within them, as everything is pretty self explanitory. You only have three guesses before the game is over so save them until you really know!
